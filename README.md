# Hostel_Lost-Found_Portal
Problem Statement
Many hostels struggle with the issue of lost and found items, where students misplace their belongings and often have difficulty locating them. Without an efficient system in place, it can be difficult for hostel authorities to manage and keep track of these items, resulting in students losing their belongings forever or spending a great deal of time searching for them. Additionally, the manual process of recording lost and found items is time-consuming and labor-intensive for hostel staff. To address this problem, there is a need for a hostel lost and found portal that can streamline the process of reporting and managing lost and found items. The goal of this project is to create a portal that will provide an efficient system for hostels to manage lost and found items, ensuring that lost items can be quickly located and making it easier for hostels to manage and return lost items to their owners.

Abstract
The importance of a hostel lost and found portal is twofold. Firstly, it helps provide transparency and reliable tracking for lost items, ensuring that they can be easily located and returned to their rightful owners. Secondly, it streamlines the process of managing lost and found items, making it easier for hostels to keep track of lost items and quickly return them to their owners. This reduces the amount of time and effort spent on searching for lost items, and ultimately increases the satisfaction of guests and staff.


Features
Several features can be added to a hostel lost and found portal to make it more useful and efficient. Some of the features that can be included in such a portal are:
1.	Found Item: When anybody finds any item that belongs to somebody else but the owner is not present, then that person can post the found item information of the item in the portal by providing the necessary information.
2.	Lost Item: When anybody loses any important item, then that person can post the information of the lost item in the portal by providing the necessary information.
3.	View lost and found Item: When anybody loses or finds any important item, then that person can view the information of the lost and found item in the portal so that he/she can find the correct person who found the item or lost the item.
